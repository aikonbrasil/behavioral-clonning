# Behavioral-clonning Project
A Neural network (CNN and NN) for end-to-end driving in virtual track, using  Keras and TensorFlow

In order to clone driving behaviour most of the deep learning knowledge provided in Nano Degree of Self Driving Car Engineer was applied using Keras and TensorFlow APIs. This submission project is composed of 5 main deliveries, listed in following lines.

* File: model.py
* File: model.h5
* File: drive.py
